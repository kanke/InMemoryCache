# :bowtie: About this application #

Implement an in memory cache. The cacheâ€™s purpose is to allow the results of expensive or long running calculations or
data retrievals to be stored in memory to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort.
You should assume:

- There will be multiple calling threads requesting data.
- You do not need to implement the underlying calculation that produces the values. Your code should be implemented so
  that it can be provided with a way to run these calculations.
- The key is the only input to the calculation which produces the value. The same key will always produce the same
  value.
- Data source lookups / calculations may be slow.

## Original Problem Statement ##

[Link to problem statement doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xt-h9w0D0gLbaQd10rIz_dZRRVLLw6ks/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116154266718479583188&rtpof=true&sd=true)

## Requirements Met ##

The requirements are:

- The cache must provide a method to request the value for a key -> Look at get(String key) in Cache interface and
  implementation
- If the cache does not contain the requested data it should load it from an underlying data source, and then cache it
  for future requests -> Look at add(String key, Object value) in Cache interface and implementation
- If the cache exceeds a set number of items in size then the least recently requested items should be removed -> Used a
  LRUMap implementation with a fixed maximum size which removes the least recently used entry if an entry is added when full. 
  The least recently used algorithm works on the get and put operations only.

- It should use generics so it can be instantiated for different types of keys and values -> Yes, this is currently
  being done, look at InMemoryCache and CacheObject Class.
